I’ve been making some changes in my life recently and feel ready for a fresh start.

It feels like the right time to pause, reflect on what I’ve learned, and carry those lessons forward with more intention. This blog is part of that effort — a space to capture what I'm thinking about, working on, and figuring out along the way.

I don’t have a fixed writing schedule (yet), but I hope to show up here regularly. Some posts may be technical, some personal, and some might just be breadcrumbs for my future self.

Thanks for reading.
