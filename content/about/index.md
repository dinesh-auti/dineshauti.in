Hi, I'm Dinesh and this site is my attempt to declutter my thoughts and hopefully help others along the way. I don’t claim to have it all figured out. But I’ve learned that even small observations can spark clarity for someone else—and that’s worth writing down.

### Why this blog exists

- To log things I’ve figured out—and the ones I haven’t.
- To share small lessons that might make someone else’s path smoother.
- To keep myself honest, curious, and growing.

### What You’ll Find Here

- **Tech & Tools**: Kubernetes, CI/CD, Infrastructure as Code, GitOps, Observability
- **TILs**: Little “Today I Learned” notes—debugging wins, weird configs, helpful flags
- **People & Process**: Notes on team dynamics, communication, and mentoring
- **Reflections**: Lessons from my career journey, burnout, imposter syndrome, and bouncing back
- **Life Logs**: Ideas, philosophies, books, and chai-fueled thoughts

### My Stack (mostly)

- **Cloud & Containers**: AWS, EKS, ECS, Karpenter, Kubernetes
- **Infra & Automation**: Terraform, Pulumi, Helm, GitHub Actions
- **Observability**: Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, Pyroscope, Tempo
- **Languages**: Go, Python, Bash

When I’m not building or automating something, you’ll find me sipping chai or spending time with my family.

I’m always looking for new opportunities to collaborate and eager to learn new things. If you have any questions, suggestions, or potential work opportunities, please feel free to reach out to me via email auti.dinesh3[at]gmail[dot]com. Here is my [Resume](/assets/dinesh-auti-resume.pdf).

Thanks for being here 🙏
